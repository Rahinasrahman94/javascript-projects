    <p>Web developers provide businesses with the unique, 
      engaging websites they need to connect with customers.
       While businesses could feasibly create their own sites using Wix,
        Squarespace, or WordPress templates, these tend to look amateurish
         and run slowly compared to sites built by professional Web Developers.
        Thanks to the high demand for professional websites, a career in web development
         is considered “future proof” meaning it will continue to be a valuable line of
          work well into the future. In fact, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects
           that web development will grow 13% over the next decade, adding approximately 
           17,900 jobs each year. This is substantially higher than the average rate of 
           job growth, which sits at around 8%.</p>
